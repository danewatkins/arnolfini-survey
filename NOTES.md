## Research question
can surveys be payful n the way that other aspects of cultural are

Real obstacles

Perceived or imagined obstacles
There was a perception that playful surveys would be difficult to read
that surveys need to be simple otherwise they might taint the databaseWould a plyaful authored survey taint the data, would the repondents be reflecting on the exhibition of on the surveys
Why are surveys so functional and absent of visual diversity

the front page text was difficult

It is not my intention to say that this better than the CC surveys or the functionalist desifn of audience engagement surveys but that there should be a greater range of design in surveys and thta a playful interface can still be effective

Important to draw a distinction between effective and efficient
## Why do a survey?

## What is the point of surveys?
What are surveys as things in themselves, as a cultural artefact what dot hey say about us, about this generation. If we compare them to other cultural artefacts, functional objects for example devon harvest jugs
Why do them?

What is a cultural artefact?
Do surveys exist outside of culture/ art decoration
What is culture

## The Poetic
Roman Jakobson
north Devon Slipware, decorating functional jugs
playful nature of poetic, also playing with words
it is not about the efficient communication of an idea but how the words sound when said
Richard Burton was known for his

## surveys as data
surveys are fundamentally more dificult than films or books, becasue of the read write permissions they have to allow the viewe or reader or user to write their own information back into the content and that creates a fundamental security weakness, an individual book may be annotated but it doesn't affect the integrity of the master copy, romeo and juilet is not changed  because so and annotated their copy
Whereas a survey can be fundamentally affected, a database that allows user content can ve inject with malicious code which can destroy the master copy
